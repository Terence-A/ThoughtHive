# Thought Hive - NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description

Thought Hive is a social network API project that aims to create a robust backend system for a social networking web application. The motivation behind this project is to build an efficient API capable of handling large volumes of unstructured data, mimicking the real-world requirements of modern social networking platforms. By implementing this API, we address the need to understand and work with NoSQL databases effectively.

Access the API routes for users and thoughts using tools like Insomnia or Postman.
Retrieve data from these routes to view user profiles and thought content in well-structured JSON format.
Test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to create, update, and delete user profiles and thoughts.
Interact with API POST and DELETE routes to create and delete reactions to thoughts, as well as manage a user's friend list.
Feel free to explore the API and adapt it for your own social networking project!
